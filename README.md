# 8 Week SQL Challenge

I am trying out a [SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) that I saw on 'Data With Danny' website. I genuinely enjoy working with SQL and uncovering new insights through data exploration. This eight-week challenge highlights both my strong SQL abilities and my commitment to using data analysis to make a meaningful impact.
